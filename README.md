# memeory
A simple recreation of a classic game called memory.

# The journey
Recreating this game was a really big learning oppertunity for me.

When I started working on the javascript, it didn't take very long before I had worked myself into a corner.
Here is a small example of my first code draft:

As you can see, it isn't hard to realise why I was closing down the directions I could go in.
After realising this, I learned the importance of scalability and flexibility.

Although a little overwelming, this was really fascinating to me. 

Looking at my own code, I realise it is quite the mess. But i'm really proud of it.
There was a lot of trial and error involved, and I loved (almost) every second of it.

# The result
I have not yet implemented some of the extra features that were suggested, but i'm looking forward to implement them in the future.
The version you're looking at now is still very barebones.

On the visual side, there is alot to be improved aswell.
